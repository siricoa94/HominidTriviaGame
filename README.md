# HominidTriviaGame

The inspiration for this trivia game came to me one day while working with somme friends on what to do. I was preoccupied with reading about the origins of the human race, and every now and then would prompt my friends with an fact I considered interesting. This gave me the idea to come up with a series of questions and to make it into a quiz for everyone to enjoy.
